    <p>From discussions we will design a cake specifically for you. Where possible we will attempt to fulfill any requirements in order to make your cake special.</p>

    <a href="#MadeToOrder"><h1>Made to Order</h1></a>
    <p>Each cake is baked to order and decorated fresh. We do not freeze cakes in advance meaning that your cake will be fresh, moist and suitable for freezing at home if you don't manage to finish it all at once.</p>

    <p>Each cake is decorated (where possible) with hand crafted and piped sugarwork.</p>
